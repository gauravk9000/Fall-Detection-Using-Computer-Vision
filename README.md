The goal is to detect human falls, primarily focused on the safety of elderly individuals, by using computer vision and machine learning

Features include image processing, BRISK feature descriptor, multiple machine learning algorithms for fall prediction

The project involves image pre-processing, feature extraction with BRISK, and applying machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN

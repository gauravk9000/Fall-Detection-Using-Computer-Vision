# Fall-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision

Falls are some of the most common issues that happen frequently. This can also lead sometimes to death. Elderly persons are at the highest risk due to which their life can be in danger. This project aims to detect fall when it occurs.

Process

• Complete image pre-processing, which includes image background removal, edge detection, star feature extractor and brisk feature descriptor.

• Used multiple machine learning algorithm like Random Forest, Decision Tree and KNN.

• Determining the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms.

• Predicting the fall.
